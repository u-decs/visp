Example on a complex non-linear case study on how to use Unscented Kalman filter
================================================================================

This example shows how to use an Unscented Kalman filter in Python.

This example is a complex non-linear case study.

The state vector and measurements are explained in the  `C++ example <https://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/ukf-nonlinear-complex-example_8cpp-example.html>`_.
